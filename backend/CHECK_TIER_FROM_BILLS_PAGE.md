# How to Check Tier Status from Bills Page

## Current Location
You're on the **Bills** page, which shows:
- **Total charges**: USD 0.00 (no charges yet)
- **Bill status**: Pending
- This confirms you haven't been charged, but doesn't show your tier status

## To See Your Tier/Plan Status:

### Method 1: Go to Billing Home/Dashboard

1. **In the left sidebar**, click **"Home"** (under "Billing and Cost Management")
2. **OR** click **"Dashboards"** (if available)
3. This will show the main Billing Dashboard
4. Look for **"Free plan status"** section at the top

### Method 2: Check Account Settings

1. **In the left sidebar**, look for **"Account"** or **"Account Settings"**
2. Click on it
3. You'll see:
   - **Account Type**: "Free Tier" or "Pay-As-You-Go"
   - **Free Tier Status**: If applicable

### Method 3: Click Your Account Name

1. **Top right corner** → Click your account name ("ankush paul")
2. Click **"Account"** from the dropdown
3. This shows account details including tier status

## What Your Bills Page Tells Us:

✅ **USD 0.00 charges** = No paid services used yet
✅ **Pending status** = Normal for current month
✅ This is consistent with Free Tier account

**But** this doesn't confirm your tier - you need to check the main Dashboard or Account page.

## Quick Navigation:

From where you are now (Bills page):

```
Left Sidebar → Click "Home"
    ↓
Main Billing Dashboard
    ↓
Look for "Free plan status" section
    ↓
See: Credits remaining, Days remaining, Account type
```

## Alternative: Check Account Dropdown

1. **Top right** → Click "ankush paul" (your account name)
2. **Click "Account"** or **"Billing"**
3. This will show your account tier status

## What You're Looking For:

### Free Tier Account Will Show:
```
Free plan status:
- Credits remaining: $119.08 USD
- Days remaining: 181 days
- Account Type: Free Tier
```

### Pay-As-You-Go Account Will Show:
```
Account Type: Pay-As-You-Go
- No "Free plan status" section
- Can see billing details
```

## Direct Link to Check:

Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/

This is the main Billing Dashboard where tier status is shown.

## Summary:

**Current Page**: Bills (shows charges, not tier status)
**What to Do**: Click "Home" in left sidebar OR click your account name → "Account"
**What to Look For**: "Free plan status" section with credits and days remaining

Based on your earlier screenshot showing $119.08 credits, you're on **Free Tier**, which is why t3.medium instances can't launch.
